Wordpress Theme for Manchester Raspberry Jam Website

## Wordpress Theme

This theme is a very minimalist design, with limited Wordpress functionality implemented.

It is also currently rather bespoke to the Manchester Raspberry Jam website, but could be easily adapted to another site.

### Forks

You call that a fork? *This* is a fork!
